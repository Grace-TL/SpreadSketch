### Files
- spreadsketch.hpp, spreadsketch.cpp: the implementation of SpreadSketch
- mrbmp.hpp, mrbmp.cpp: the implementation of multiresolution bitmap (distinct
  counters in SpreadSketch)
- main\_ss.cpp: example about superspreader detection
- p4/spreadsketch.p4: p4 implementation of SpreadSketch

### Compile and Run the examples
SpreadSketch is implemented with C++. We show how to compile the examples on
Ubuntu with g++ and make.

#### Requirements
- Ensure __g++__ and __make__ are installed.  Our experimental platform is
  equipped with Ubuntu 14.04, g++ 4.8.4 and make 3.81.

- Ensure the necessary library libpcap is installed.
    - It can be installed in most Linux distributions (e.g., apt-get install
      libpcap-dev in Ubuntu).

- Prepare the pcap files.
    - We provide two small pcap files
      [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLEjB-w4ZlNshl1vUMb98rrowFuMBWuJ/view?usp=sharing).
      You can download and put them in the "traces" folder for testing.  
    - Specify the path of each pcap file in "iptraces.txt". 
    - Note that one pcap file is regarded as one epoch in our examples. 

#### Compile
- Compile examples with make
    - Run the example of SpreadSketch 
```
    $ make main_ss
```
    - Run the example of HP-SpreadSketch

```
    $ make main_ss_hp
```

#### Run
- Run the examples, and the program will output some statistics about the detection accuracy. 

```
$ ./main_ss
```

- Note that you can change the configuration of SpreadSketch, e.g. number of rows and buckets in the example source code for testing.
